# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project.
In this week challenge, we were given a significant ammount of data regarding wall street stocks. We are trying to help our friend steve. Steve was helping his parents invest in stocks, his parents were really excited in green energy, so they decided to invest in companies that were related to green energy. Steve was a bit concern with their performance, but analysing the data manually seemed a bit uneficient. We decided to help him and run analysis on the stock performances to present them and identify them in a more simple way. 

For this project we used and learned VBA (Visual Basic for Applications. With the help of this tool, we were able to automatize the analysis and calculus needed to analyze each stock. Not only that, but we also made sure to refactore the code and garantee a more efficient solution, capable of being used in larger datasets containing more than 12 stocks.
